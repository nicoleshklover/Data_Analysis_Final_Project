## Introduction

This project was the final assignment for a Statistics and Data Analysis with R course at Tel Aviv University. It involved various phases of a data analysis project, including data importing, data tidying, understanding the data, visualizing data using ggplot2, modeling with tools such as hypothesis testing and regression, and communicating findings through a written report.

## Project's Goal

Our project focused on college tuition data, and we aimed to explore how a student's demographic background might influence various academic characteristics, including school tuition, future salaries, the percentage of STEM students, and more. Our primary goal was to uncover meaningful connections within the academic world.

## Data Source

You can access the dataset we used via the following link: [College Tuition Dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/readme.md).

## Outcome

We found that unfortunately even now days race, sex and nationality has an influence on school tuition and future salary. <br>
We received a grade of 93 for our project. The entire project was implemented using R programming language within R Studio.
