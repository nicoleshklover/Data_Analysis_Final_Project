# College Tuition, Diversity, and Pay

## Authors: Nicole Shklover and Ariel Hedvat

**Date:** 10.06.2022

## Introduction

This project was the final assignment for a Statistics and Data Analysis with R course at Tel Aviv University. It involved various phases of a data analysis project, including data importing, data tidying, understanding the data, visualizing data using ggplot2, modeling with tools such as hypothesis testing and regression, and communicating findings through a written report.

## Project Goal

Our project focused on college tuition data, and we aimed to explore how a student's demographic background might influence various academic characteristics, including school tuition, future salaries, the percentage of STEM students, and more. Our primary goal was to uncover meaningful connections within the academic world.

## Data Source

You can access the dataset we used via the following link: [College Tuition Dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/readme.md).

## Outcome

We are delighted to report that we received a grade of 93 for our project. The entire project was implemented using the R programming language within R Studio.

This was the final project for a Statistics and Data Analysis with R course at Tel Aviv University. <br><br>

In this project we were asked to handle the different phases of a data analysis project:
1. Data Importing (reading the data into R).
2. Data Tidying (arranging the data into something we can work with)
3. Understanding the data: <br>
  a) Transforming variables. <br>
  b) Visualizing (using ggplot2 to show distribution of variables, relationships between variables, and to hypothesize). <br>
  c) Modelling: using a few of the tools we have learned during the course (like hypothesis testing, regression, analysis of variance, etc.) to examine our hypothesis. <br>
4. Communicating our findings via a written report. <br><br>

First we selected a dataset on which we performed the project.<br>
Our project is based on College tuition data. <br>

We were interested in understanding how the group to which the student belongs, may affect characteristics in the academic world, such as: school tuition, salaries in the future, STEM students percentage and more.
Our main goal was to find meaningful connections between the characteristics in the academic.

We recieved a grade of 93 on the project.<br>
The project's code is implemented using R language (in R studio).<br><br>
