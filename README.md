This was the final project for a Statistics and Data Analysis with R course at Tel Aviv University. <br><br>

In this project we were asked to handle the different phases of a data analysis project:
1. Data Importing (reading the data into R).
2. Data Tidying (arranging the data into something we can work with)
3. Understanding the data: <br>
  a) Transforming variables. <br>
  b) Visualizing (using ggplot2 to show distribution of variables, relationships between variables, and to hypothesize). <br>
  c) Modelling: using a few of the tools we have learned during the course (like hypothesis testing, regression, analysis of variance, etc.) to examine our hypothesis. <br>
4. Communicating our findings via a written report. <br><br>

First we selected a dataset on which we performed the project.<br>
Our project is based on College tuition data. <br>

We were interested in understanding how the group to which the student belongs, may affect characteristics in the academic world, such as: school tuition, salaries in the future, STEM students percentage and more.
Our main goal was to find meaningful connections between the characteristics in the academic.

We recieved a grade of 93 on the project.
The project's code is implemented using R language (in R studio).<br><br>
